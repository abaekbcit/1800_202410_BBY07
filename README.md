# Up To Date

## 1. Project Description
Our team BBY07 is developing a web application to help anyone find the perfect date by finding the best match based on given preferences, unlike Google reviews or Yelp, which don’t have the most personal or authentic feeling reviews.

## 5. Known Bugs and Limitations
Here are some known bugs:
* Image URLS given by Google API eventually expire. So any spots submitted through spot search form will have images that expire.
* Ratings aren't recalculated on review deletion (deleted review's ratings still affect the date spot's ratings)
* After deleting a spot from the DB, reviews related to that spot aren't deleted.
* Uploading image for submitting a review or manual entry of a date spot no longer works (broke after some commit)
* Some parts of pages don't show on mobile view.

## 6. Features for Future
What we'd like to build in the future:
* Pagination for displayed cards
* Using category as a parameter for querying date spots
* Some level of checking to keep date spots unique (minimize chances of duplicate entries)
* Refreshing image URLs given by Google places API before expiration
* More styling in general
